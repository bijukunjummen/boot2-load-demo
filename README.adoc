# Spring Boot2 Performance Harness

This is a sample Spring Boot 2 app to demonstrate the raw performance difference between a Spring Boot 2 app vs a Spring Boot 1 app. 


= Backing Service

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew -p applications/sample-load-target clean bootRun
----

= Spring Boot 2 based app:

== Run the Spring Boot 2 based app:
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew -p applications/boot2-load-sample clean bootRun
----

== Call target endpoint

Assuming that https://httpie.org/[httpie] is installed

[source, bash]
----
http POST 'http://localhost:8082/passthrough/messages' id="1" payload="one"   delay="1000"
----

OR with CURL

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8082/passthrough/messages" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
  "id": "1",
  "payload": "one",
  "delay": "1000"
}'
----


= Spring Boot 1 based app:

== Run the Spring Boot 1 based app:
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew -p applications/boot1-load-sample clean bootRun
----

== Call target endpoint

Assuming that https://httpie.org/[httpie] is installed

[source, bash]
----
http POST 'http://localhost:8081/passthrough/messages' id="1" payload="one"   delay="1000"
----

OR with CURL

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8081/passthrough/messages" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
  "id": "1",
  "payload": "one",
  "delay": "1000"
}'
----

= Spring Cloud Gateway based app:

== Run the app:
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew -p applications/spring-cloud-gateway-sample clean bootRun
----

== Call target endpoint

Assuming that https://httpie.org/[httpie] is installed

[source, bash]
----
http POST 'http://localhost:8083/passthrough/messages' id="1" payload="one"   delay="1000"
----

OR with CURL

[source, bash]
----
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8083/passthrough/messages" \
     -H "Accept: application/json" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
  "id": "1",
  "payload": "one",
  "delay": "1000"
}'

= Run Load tests

== Against Boot 2 version of the app
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew -p applications/load-scripts  -DTARGET_URL=http://localhost:8082 -DSIM_USERS=300 gatlingRun
----

== Against Boot 1 version of the app
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew -p applications/load-scripts  -DTARGET_URL=http://localhost:8081 -DSIM_USERS=300 gatlingRun
----

== Against Spring Cloud Gateway version of the app
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew -p applications/load-scripts  -DTARGET_URL=http://localhost:8083 -DSIM_USERS=300 gatlingRun
